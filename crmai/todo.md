## Phase 1: Analyze existing code for optimization opportunities ✓
- [x] Review `app_secure.py` for general structure, error handling, and routing.
- [x] Review `auth.py` for authentication logic, JWT handling, and database interactions.
- [x] Review `rate_limiting.py` for Redis and PostgreSQL interactions, and decorator usage.

## Phase 2: Implement code optimizations ✓
- [x] Refactor database connection handling to reduce overhead.
- [x] Centralize error handling for API endpoints.
- [x] Replace magic numbers/strings with constants or configuration.
- [x] Optimize query logic in `app_secure.py` and `auth.py`.
- [x] Improve code readability and maintainability (e.g., function decomposition, clearer variable names).

## Phase 3: Verify functionality of refactored code
- [ ] Run existing tests to ensure no regressions.
- [ ] Manually test key API endpoints.

## Phase 4: Document changes and provide refactored code
- [ ] Generate a report detailing optimizations.
- [ ] Package the refactored codebase.
